        <h3 id="lesson-text2">
There are many ways to help with spacing. First of all, there are divs, big big parts in html. They order things vertically. Spans are also very big and are used to have thing in a horizontal line. There are also br's, or break tags, which have spacing between to things. Finally, we have hr, which creates a line. Hr stands for horizontal ruler. The br tag add a line break to the output. However, adding a line-break using Enter command is only for the source of the document. Using css, the margin attribute can be also used for making distance.
